Verifies that the citations in a document are real, accurately described, and
consistently used — including the fabricated-citation signature an AI-drafted
bibliography produces: a real title carrying the wrong authors, or a plausible
reference to a paper that does not exist.

Useful for students and examiners, and for anyone checking a reference list a
model wrote.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install touchneedle
touchneedle check thesis.docx --out report.md
```

`report.md` opens with the entries that failed a check, worst first, then the
cross-reference pass in both directions. Exit status is 2 when something needs
attention and 0 when the list is clean, so the same command drops into CI
unchanged.

Nothing is needed beyond Python 3.11+. `pandoc` has to be on PATH for `.docx`
input, and for nothing else.

## Why not a .bib checker

Most commercial citation checkers want a `.bib` file and check it against academic
databases. That covers journal articles but misses standards,
specifications, vendor documentation, and blog posts. In a lot of real
bibliographies, this is half the list.

So this tool parses a **prose reference list** straight out of Markdown or
`.docx`, in the four style families a real document uses — author-date
(Harvard, APA, Chicago author-date), numeric (IEEE, Vancouver/AMA), MLA, and
footnote styles (Chicago notes, MHRA) — and routes each entry to whichever
authority can actually confirm it. The style is auto-detected, or forced with
`--style`.

## What it checks

**Existence and metadata** — scripted and deterministic:

| Entry carries | Checked against |
|---|---|
| arXiv id | arXiv API |
| DOI | Crossref |
| RFC number | IETF datatracker, falling back to rfc-editor |
| `draft-*` name | IETF datatracker, **including whether the cited revision is still current** |
| Quoted title in an academic venue | Crossref, then OpenAlex, by title |
| A URL and nothing else | Fetched live; page title compared with the cited title |

Entries with both an identifier and a URL get both, so a real paper behind a dead
link is still reported. An entry the retrieved record contradicts comes back as
`MISMATCH` — but only where the record is the cited work by construction, which
means an identifier. A title search returns neighbours, so a poor match there is
reported as not found, with the closest candidate named, rather than as a
disagreement the search is in no position to assert.

**Internal consistency** — every in-text citation resolves to a list entry, every
list entry is cited somewhere, and `2025a`/`2025b` suffixes are used
unambiguously. Bracket markers resolve by number, author-page citations by
surname, footnote markers through their note — a shortened note or an `Ibid.`
links to the full citation it repeats.

**Claim support** — the pass that needs reading rather than fetching. `claims`
emits a worklist pairing each in-text citation with the sentence making the claim
and a locator for the source, to be ruled SUPPORTED / PARTIAL / UNSUPPORTED /
INACCESSIBLE one row at a time. This catches the failure the database checks
cannot: a genuine source attached to a claim it does not make. Who does that
reading is the subject of [Two ways to run it](#two-ways-to-run-it).

## What it produces

A Markdown report, worst findings first. From the test fixture, run live:

```markdown
## Entries needing attention

### STALE — IETF (2025a)

> IETF (2025a) 'The OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework', Internet-Draft draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13.

- cited as -13 but the current revision is -15; an Internet-Draft is a moving
  target, so confirm the cited text survived

### NOT_FOUND — Uncited (2021)

> Uncited, A. (2021) 'A paper that nobody in this document cites', Journal of
> Irreproducible Results. doi:10.1000/uncited.

- Crossref has no record for DOI 10.1000/uncited

## Cross-reference consistency

### In-text citations with no matching reference entry

- `Nonexistent (2019)` — …An orphan citation appears here (Nonexistent, 2019).…
```

[The full report](docs/example-report.md) — five entries verified against arXiv,
Crossref and the IETF datatracker, one link that has quietly moved, and the
cross-reference pass in both directions.

`--json` writes the same results machine-readably, for a CI step or a dashboard.

## Two ways to run it

touchneedle is a command-line program. `check` is entirely scripted — it fetches
records and compares fields, so it returns the same answer every run, with no
model involved anywhere in it.

`claims` is the half the script cannot finish. It emits a worklist: each in-text
citation, the sentence that cites it, and a locator for the source. Ruling on
those rows means reading the sources, which is a judgement rather than a lookup.

So there are two ways to work that list. Do it yourself, from a terminal. Or run
the tool inside a coding agent, which calls the same script for the scripted
pass and then reads each source to fill in the second. The agent path is not a
different tool and not a wrapper — it is `scripts/touchneedle.py` either way.

### From a terminal

```bash
pip install touchneedle

touchneedle check thesis.docx --out report.md --json data.json
touchneedle claims thesis.docx --out claims.md
```

From a clone, without installing, that is `python3 scripts/touchneedle.py …` —
the same file.

### Inside Claude Code

As a skill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicoleman0/touchneedle ~/.claude/skills/touchneedle
```

Or as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add nicoleman0/touchneedle
/plugin install touchneedle
```

Either way, ask for it in plain words — *"check the citations in thesis.docx"* —
and the model runs `check`, reads the report, then works the claims worklist
source by source.

## Options and exit codes

Both subcommands take the document, and:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--out FILE` | Write the report here instead of stdout |
| `--style STYLE` | `auto` (default), `author-date`, `numeric`, `mla` or `notes`. Force one when detection guesses wrong |

`check` takes five more, all of them about reaching the network:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--json FILE` | Also write the results machine-readably, for a CI step or a dashboard |
| `--offline` | Parse and cross-check only, contacting nothing. Useful for smoke-testing the parse |
| `--cache DIR` | HTTP cache, 7-day TTL, so re-runs are nearly free |
| `--timeout N` | Per-request timeout, 25 seconds by default |
| `--mailto ADDRESS` | Contact address for Crossref and OpenAlex's polite rate-limit pool |

`--mailto` is off by default and never inferred, because it sends an address to
third parties. It is also read from `CITATION_CHECK_MAILTO`.

`check` exits 2 when something needs attention and 0 when clean. `claims` always
exits 0 — it asks a question rather than answering one.

## Statuses

`MISMATCH` and `NOT_FOUND` are the ones that damage a submission. `LINK_DEAD` and
`STALE` need a fix but not a retraction. `PARTIAL`, `LINK_MOVED` and
`UNVERIFIABLE` are for a glance — notably, PDFs and JS-rendered pages land in
`PARTIAL` routinely, because no `<title>` can be read from them. A `PARTIAL` is a
limit of the check, not evidence against the citation.

## Limits

Page numbers, edition and publisher details are not checked.

MLA narrative citations that end in a bare page number (`Smith argues the
point (42)`) are not matched, because a bare parenthesised number cannot be
told from any other parenthesised digit. A shortened footnote note that cannot
be linked to its full citation is kept as an entry with a caveat rather than
silently merged.

The list of in-text citations with no matching entry has expected false
positives: a regex cannot distinguish `(Smith, 2024)` from `(ICLR 2023)`, or
`[12]` from a figure reference. The report says which shape to expect per
style.

Sources behind paywalls cannot be verified beyond their metadata record.
